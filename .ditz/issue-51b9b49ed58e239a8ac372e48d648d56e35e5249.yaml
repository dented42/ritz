title: Generic UUID backing store
desc: |-
  Create a generic storage module that allows storing arbitrary values with UUIDs
  that abstracts over how the values are actually stored. This way it can be made
  to work with a filesystem based storage mechanism (like ditz), as well as
  perhaps even an in memory store or database.

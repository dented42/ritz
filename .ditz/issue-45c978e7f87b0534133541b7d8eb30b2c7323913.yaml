title: Repair issue store command
desc: |-
  Create a command that users can invoke that repairs a damaged issue store. They
  should either be able to specify what needs to be repaired (that is, what
  repairs should be carried out), or the command should be able to try and
  determine what work needs to be done to make the issue store consistent.
